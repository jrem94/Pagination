# Pagination
Tech Degree Project from Team Treehouse.

Goal: Take a list of students (of any number) and use pagination to display only 10 at a time. This should be done using unobtrusive JavaScript so that if a user has JS turned off, or if a user is using an outdated browser, the full student list will still display.

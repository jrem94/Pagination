# Pagination
Tech Degree Project from Team Treehouse.

Goal: Take a list of students (of any number) and use pagination to display only 10 at a time. This should be done using unobtrusive JavaScript so that if a user has JS turned off, or if a user is using an outdated browser, the full student list will still display.

Created unobtrusive JavaScript that applies pagination to a list of any number of students. If JavaScript is disabled, then the full student list is displayed as not to hinder the viewer from the core content of the page.
